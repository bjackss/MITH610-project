    <h1>The Labor of Black Student Organizers</h1>
    <div id="description"><p>Encoding affords the opportunity for some restorative work to be done with archival materials. Archives tell incomplete stories, mediated by hosts of entities as materials are re-housed and their stories re-framed. While archival materials themselves may never truly be presented in complete context, encoding affords the ability to begin to address the shortcomings of objects housed in archives by providing background information, highlighting embedded narratives, and gesturing to what may be lost. As archives and their infrastructure have been produced within a racialized society they reproduce these hierarchies in practice prizing whiteness and stifling Black voices. To this end, following the work of Jessica LU and others at AADhum, I have encoded the following articles in an attempt to highlight the lived experiences of black people at the University of Maryland.</p>
 <p>These articles present examples of black student-led protest and organizing work in 1968 and 1970, respectively. The first, written by Andy Chischom, presents a first-hand retelling of a protest organized by the Black Student Union (BSU). The second, by Maryanne Gallagher outlines the back-and-forth the BSU went through after securing a meeting with the university president and issuing a list of demands. The two articles in tandem show the amount and variety of labor that black student organizers undertook to address issues of racial injustice on campus. People of color not only suffer the inequities and violence of this racialized system, but also take on the labor of leading social reform. This work, and especially in the case of womxn organizers, often goes under-recognized in re-tellings of these movements. In an attempt at some restorative practice, I focused my encoding of these two articles to highlight the organizational labor of the black students involved.</p>
	<p>The first way in which this intention manifests was in re-considering what would be tagged as an organization. Both articles mention groups of around 200 students gathered in protest of racial discrimination on campus. In both cases I tagged these 200 students as organizations to highlight the labor and organizational infrastructure necessary to gather that many students in protest. Groups gathered in protest may not have the institutional recognition and stability of more formally recognized organizations, but to not consider them organizations ignores the labor involved in their production. To draw attention to this, organizations have been bolded.</p>
	<p>The second and primary way that I centered this encoding around the labor of black student organizers was in the use of interpretation tags. I created five tags to showcase different elements of the work done by students and the response from administration. The first pair, issues (#ISS) and demands (#DEM) showcase the negotiations students made between the major systemic issues and what specific demands they put forth. Often times, the students involved with the BSU were asking for very little in their demands when compared to the actual issues at stake: systemic violence and inequity. The students showed administration specific ways they could make the lives of black students better: living wages, educational opportunities, legal protections, but often those in power found ways to dismiss or defer these demands. To highlight the disparities between what university officials affirmed in written or spoken responses and in what they chose to do I used a second pair of tags: responses (#RE) and actions (#ACT). In the first article, the responses made by administrative officials during the protest are few and their actions are standing and staring rather than engaging the protesting students.In the second article, the university administration offers a response for almost every demand made by the BSU but few receive any action whatsoever. I do not intend this to be any sort of critique of the efficacy of protest, as such a thing is impossible to measure. Rather, I believe this highlights the opportunities that black student organizers offered administrators, and the way in which these people chose to respond. In the first article, Chischom uses creative turns of phrase as a form of resistance, so in this article I have chosen to tag such passages as prose (#PRS). Comparing Elkins to Nero or Martin to a cartoon shows creative critique but also Chischomâ€™s taking on the danger of writing in such a way. The last tag I created follows the intent of my use of orgName tags in trying to highlight the labor inherent in organizing. The organizing (#ORG) interpretation tag was used around evidence of the work done to put together the protests and meetings with university officials. As previously stated this kind of labor often is taken up by students of color who are under-represented in historical accounts of organizing on college campuses. I hope that by tagging organizing some light can be shed on the intense amount of work that goes into putting together protests and meetings such as these. All text marked with an interpretation tag appears in blue.</p>
	<p>I believe that there is still much work to be done in re-writing the narratives of student organizers on college campuses in the 1960s. The history of protest in the United States is still whitewashed in its popular telling, and organizing continues to be undervalued in terms of the labor it entails. The encoding decisions put forth in these two articles could be used on a larger body of texts that cover protests on college campuses, and following Hartman, a degree of critical fabulation could be employed in an effort to address the absences in these works. Language that describes seemingly chaotic masses of protestors could be re-considered and these students could be labeled an organization, shifting focus to the work that went into bringing these people together. Where administrators offer no response or action, those absences could be tagged highlighting the lack of acknowledgement. As the labor of people of color is constantly under-represented, encoding in this way affords an opportunity for corrective work on the historical record, continuing the long path toward equitable archival presentation.</p></div>
