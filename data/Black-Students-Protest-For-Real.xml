    <body>
      <div>
        <p>About 200 black brothers staged a<lb/>
protest rally in front of the home <choice><orig>eco-­nomics</orig><reg>economics</reg></choice><lb/>
building Wednesday. Also <choice><orig>pre­-sent</orig><reg>present</reg></choice><lb/>
were about 100 white sympathizers.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>This rally, unlike past rallies had one<lb/>
important factor. There was a strong<lb/>
sincerity in the sisters and brothers<lb/>
to rid themselves of the problem of<lb/>
discrimination. Often there were black<lb/>
sisters standing with emotion filling<lb/>
their faces, telling it like it is. Brothers<lb/>
were speaking with hard feeling words.<lb/>
They often yelled out at the <choice><orig>adminis-­tration</orig><reg>administration</reg></choice><lb/>
telling them to cut out the bull<lb/>
and get to the nitty gritty.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>University administrator J. Winston<lb/>
standing on the home economics<lb/>
steps looked just like Dennis the <choice><orig>Men­-
ance's</orig><reg>Menace's</reg></choice> father after finding out his son had<lb/>
done an injustice to a neighbor. I feel<lb/>
that Martin really wanted to help but<lb/>
like his friend Robert A, Beach, he knew<lb/>
nothing could be done.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Beach was called from among the<lb/>
spectators to the witness stand but upon<lb/>
arriving, declined to answer any <choice><orig>ques­-tions</orig><reg>questions</reg></choice><lb/>
for fear of incriminating himself.<lb/>
He kept staring at that big <choice><orig>administra­-tion</orig><reg>administration</reg></choice><lb/>
building in the foreground of the<lb/>
steps as if he was under some mystical<lb/>
power.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The black students constantly asked<lb/>
the two men what were they going to<lb/>
do about a program that proved to be<lb/>
based on discrimination. Neither could<lb/>
answer although Martin made more at­<lb/>
tempts than Beach. The black students<lb/>
finally gave up on Beach and continued<lb/>
to confront Martin.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>It must be understood here and now<lb/>
that the black students want answers<lb/>
to these demands. It is clear that Martin<lb/>
and Beach cannot supply them. When<lb/>
the blacks asked where Elkins was and<lb/>
demanded that he come out to the rally,<lb/>
Martin stood confused and Beach looked<lb/>
stupid.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Our president must face reality on this<lb/>
campus. As one white student put it,<lb/>
"this campus is like a powder keg and<lb/>
about to go off." Issues such as these<lb/>
must be met head on. They can't be<lb/>
handled by a pacifier of the president.<lb/>
This just won’t work anymore.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Black students have finally gotten<lb/>
wise to the tactics used by this <choice><orig>univer­-sity.</orig><reg>university</reg></choice><lb/>
We are not going to sit by and<lb/>
watch ourselves be made to look like<lb/>
fools while the administration sits back<lb/>
and laughs at us. This event is not just<lb/>
a happening on campus. It is for real<lb/>
and these questions presented are going<lb/>
to be answered by someone who has<lb/>
authority.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Our white brothers showed this <choice><orig>ad-­ministration</orig><reg>administration</reg></choice><lb/>
that this is not just a one<lb/>
way process. They threw just as many<lb/>
questions to the establishment as blacks<lb/>
did.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Black and white students know change<lb/>
must come, but the old roots just<lb/>
sprout. Progress is not checked at the<lb/>
student level. The administration is the<lb/>
one holding progress up.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The old stlU have old ideas but the
young have the new motor.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>BSU calls upon Nero Elkins to hear the<lb/>
cries of the students. He must no longer<lb/>
place the students in the arena. He must<lb/>
no longer let the students fight among<lb/>
themselves.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>We ask him to come before us not next<lb/>
semester but now.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The members of BSU are now using<lb/>
true black power. BSU president Bob<lb/>
McLeod says <q>“the white student can<lb/>
support this cause."</q> First he must open<lb/>
his mind to the fact that blacks are going<lb/>
to deal with black problems.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The white support must come from<lb/>
white organizations. This is due to the<lb/>
fact that whites relate better to whites<lb/>
and can explain their positions on the<lb/>
racial situation much more clearly to<lb/>
their peers than can a black student.<lb/>
This is how black and white work<lb/>
together. I ask the white student not<lb/>
to get confused on this issue. All people<lb/>
are needed in a struggle such as this --<lb/>
even Toms and white liberals.<lb/></p>
