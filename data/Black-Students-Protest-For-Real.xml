              <note>The protestors in this article are referred to in a wide
              array of terms. This orgnization tag is used to firstly represent
              the labor and infrastructure created to support the bringing-together
              of so many people. Secondly, this tag is used to try to more accurately
              represent those presen, in particular the women of color wh are left out
              when the writer uses male-gendered language to refer to the participants
              of the protest. Wherever the author was referring specifically to the
              participants of the protest, this tag is used.</note>

      <div>
        <p>About <orgName ref="#UMDP">200 black brothers</orgName> staged a<lb/>
protest rally in front of the home <choice><orig>eco-­nomics</orig><reg>economics</reg></choice><lb/>
building Wednesday. Also <choice><orig>pre­-sent</orig><reg>present</reg></choice><lb/>
were about 100 white sympathizers.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>This rally, unlike past rallies had one<lb/>
important factor. There was a strong<lb/>
sincerity in the sisters and brothers<lb/>
to rid themselves of the problem of<lb/>
discrimination. Often there were black<lb/>
sisters standing with emotion filling<lb/>
their faces, telling it like it is. Brothers<lb/>
were speaking with hard feeling words.<lb/>
They often yelled out at the <choice><orig>adminis-­tration</orig><reg>administration</reg></choice><lb/>
telling them to cut out the bull<lb/>
and get to the nitty gritty.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>University administrator <persName ref="#JM">J. Winston</persName><lb/>
standing on the home economics<lb/>
steps looked just like Dennis the <choice><orig>Men­-
ance's</orig><reg>Menace's</reg></choice><lb/>
father after finding out his son had<lb/>
done an injustice to a neighbor. I feel<lb/>
that <persName ref="#JM">Martin</persName> really wanted to help but<lb/>
like his friend <persName ref="#RB">Robert A. Beach</persName>, he knew<lb/>
nothing could be done.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><persName ref="#RB">Beach</persName> was called from among the<lb/>
spectators to the witness stand but upon<lb/>
arriving, declined to answer any <choice><orig>ques­-tions</orig><reg>questions</reg></choice><lb/>
for fear of incriminating himself.<lb/>
He kept staring at that big <choice><orig>administra­-tion</orig><reg>administration</reg></choice><lb/>
building in the foreground of the<lb/>
steps as if he was under some mystical<lb/>
power.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><orgName ref="UMDP">The black students</orgName> constantly asked<lb/>
the two men what were they going to<lb/>
do about a program that proved to be<lb/>
based on discrimination. Neither could<lb/>
answer although <persName ref="#JM">Martin</persName> made more at­<lb/>
tempts than <persName ref="#RB">Beach</persName>. <orgName ref="UMDP">The black students</orgName><lb/>
finally gave up on <persName ref="#RB">Beach</persName> and continued<lb/>
to confront <persName ref="#JM">Martin</persName>.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>It must be understood here and now<lb/>
that the black students want answers<lb/>
to these demands. It is clear that <persName ref="#JM">Martin</persName><lb/>
and <persName ref="#RB">Beach</persName> cannot supply them. When<lb/>
the blacks asked where <persName ref="#WE">Elkins</persName> was and<lb/>
demanded that he come out to the rally,<lb/>
<persName ref="#JM">Martin</persName> stood confused and <persName ref="#RB">Beach</persName> looked<lb/>
stupid.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Our <persName ref="#WE">president</persName> must face reality on this<lb/>
campus. As one white student put it,<lb/>
<q>"this campus is like a powder keg and<lb/>
about to go off."</q> Issues such as these<lb/>
must be met head on. They can't be<lb/>
handled by a pacifier of <persName ref="#WE">the president</persName>.<lb/>
This just won’t work anymore.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Black students have finally gotten<lb/>
wise to the tactics used by this <orgName ref="#UMD"><choice><orig>univer­-sity.</orig><reg>university</reg></choice></orgName><lb/>
We are not going to sit by and<lb/>
watch ourselves be made to look like<lb/>
fools while <orgName ref="#UMDADM">the administration</orgName> sits back<lb/>
and laughs at us. This event is not just<lb/>
a happening on campus. It is for real<lb/>
and these questions presented are going<lb/>
to be answered by someone who has<lb/>
authority.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Our white brothers showed this <orgName ref="#UMDADM"><choice><orig>ad-­ministration</orig><reg>administration</reg></choice></orgName><lb/>
that this is not just a one<lb/>
way process. They threw just as many<lb/>
questions to <orgName ref="#UMDADM">the establishment</orgName> as blacks<lb/>
did.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Black and white students know change<lb/>
must come, but the old roots just<lb/>
sprout. Progress is not checked at the<lb/>
student level. <orgName ref="#UMDADM">The administration</orgName> is the<lb/>
one holding progress up.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The old still have old ideas but the
young have the new motor.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><orgName ref="#BSU">BSU</orgName> calls upon <persName ref="#WE">Nero Elkins</persName> to hear the<lb/>
cries of the students. He must no longer<lb/>
place the students in the arena. He must<lb/>
no longer let the students fight among<lb/>
themselves.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>We ask him to come before us not next<lb/>
semester but now.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The members of <orgName ref="#BSU">BSU</orgName> are now using<lb/>
true black power. <orgName ref="#BSU">BSU</orgName> president <persName ref="#BM">Bob<lb/>
McLeod</persName> says <q>“the white student can<lb/>
support this cause."</q> First he must open<lb/>
his mind to the fact that blacks are going<lb/>
to deal with black problems.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The white support must come from<lb/>
white organizations. This is due to the<lb/>
fact that whites relate better to whites<lb/>
and can explain their positions on the<lb/>
racial situation much more clearly to<lb/>
their peers than can a black student.<lb/>
This is how black and white work<lb/>
together. I ask the white student not<lb/>
to get confused on this issue. All people<lb/>
are needed in a struggle such as this --<lb/>
even Toms and white liberals.<lb/></p>
